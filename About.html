	<div id="Bio">
		My name is Colton Witt and I am a crybaby with a camera. Emotions consume me and control me. In my photography, I feed off of over-dramatization of emotions and personal life events. Hollywood kitsch cinema film, and horror are huge inspirations for me, and each image I create looks as if it is a still from a film. The longing for childhood, and the separation from nature has debilitated me. Since I was young, nature was my haven in which I could create dream like images to escape, but city living has caused my mind to collapse. An entirely new way of thinking and creating had to be born from the rubble. To cope with the loss of my natural habitat, I chose to delve deeper into my own being, bring many things I keep hidden to the surface. While diving deeper, I found that a new comfort came from self-deprecation. Most view self- deprecation negatively, but it is essential for my work. Every photograph I take is in some way, exposing or making fun of a serious moment or emotions I have felt in my life. My own emotions and inner demons take on the role of the atmosphere, and models in my photographs. I bring these emotions out through self-portraiture and strict staging techniques, constructing the image meticulously so there is nothing to distract from the mood. These self-portraits allow for reflection, which enables me to study how dramatic I truly am, and watch the progression of my mental state. This allows me to create stories for others to see, while documenting my growth and decline over the years.
